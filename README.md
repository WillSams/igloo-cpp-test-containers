# C++ Unit Testing Containers

Collection of Docker containers for unit testing C++ projects using [Igloo](https://github.com/codewars/igloo).  These containers are available for Windows, Linux, MacOS, and the Nintendo Switch projects.

Useful if you want to run your unit tests in a CI/CD pipeline.  Just use these as a base container and copy your files over to test.

Note:  the only container actually tested so far is the Linux one.  Also, I'll add a Windows one eventually.
